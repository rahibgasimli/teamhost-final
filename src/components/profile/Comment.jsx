                <p>Men are simple things. They can survive a whole weekend with only three things: beer, boxer shorts and batteries for the remote control. I can drive 10 miles, walk 50 feet. Turn around and before I know it, I'd be back home. Or would I? I'm not sure but that's just how it is.Sometimes I wonder if I really can. But then I think to myself, maybe I can't. But if I could, that would be good. Maybe it's all a lie?</p>
